# 01 - Buffer vs Stream

## 01.1 buffers intro

Let's create a Node.js script to copy a file from one place to another:

```javascript
// buffer-copy.js

const {
  readFileSync,
  writeFileSync
} = require('fs')

const [,, src, dest] = process.argv

// read entire file content
const content = readFileSync(src)

// write that content somewhere else
writeFileSync(dest, content)
```

You can use this script as follows:

```bash
node buffer-copy <source-file> <dest-file>
```

> \[üé≠ PLAY\]
> Play with this a bit and try to copy some files in your machine.

But did you ever wonder what happens when you try to copy a big file (more than 1.5Gb)?

> \[üé≠ PLAY\]
> Generate a big file (3gb) called file.txt in your machine with:
>
> ```bash
> dd if=/dev/zero of=file.txt count=3145728 bs=3145728
> ```
>
> Now try to copy it with our previous script.

What happens is that you should see your script dramatically failing with the following error:

```plain
ERR_FS_FILE_TOO_LARGE: File size is greater than possible Buffer
```

Why is this happening?
