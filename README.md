# streams-workshop

A workshop on Node.js Streams


## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites in your system:

- Node.js 12.3+
- NPM 6.9.0
- A recent version of Google Chrome
- a text editor of your choice
- a bash-compatible shell


## Getting started

Clone the repository and run `npm install` to get all the necessary dependencies.

The workshop is divided in chapters and the first chapter starts at [`01-buffer-vs-stream`](01-buffer-vs-stream/README.md).

Every chapter will teach you a specific stream concept and offer you some examples and exercises to familiarize with that concept.

You will often find 2 different types of interactive actions:

- **üé≠ PLAY** : commands or instructions you should spend some time with to get familiar with some concepts or APIs
- **üèπ Exercise**: when you have to use some of the concepts you just learned to solve a programming problem. Generally every exercise will have a test that you can run to validate your solution.


Some slides will be available to complement the workshop material.

Enjoy! üôÉ
