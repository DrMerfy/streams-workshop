## 03.1 What is a Writable stream

A Writable stream is an abstraction that allows to write data over a destination. In a way you can see Writable streams as an abstraction for output.

Some notable instances of Writable streams:

- Writing to a file with `fs.createWriteStream()`
- Command line standard output and standard error (`process.stdout`, `process.stderr`)
- An HTTP request (when sent by a client)
- An HTTP response (when sent by a server)
- AWS S3 `PutObject` (`body` parameter)


## 03.2 Using Writable streams

Let's try to use a Writable stream to send an HTTP request to a server. We are not going to use any third party HTTP library, we will rely on the native Node.js `http` module.

```javascript
// writable-http-request.js

const http = require('http')

const req = http.request(
  {
    hostname: 'enx6b07hdu6cs.x.pipedream.net',
    method: 'POST'
  },
  (resp) => {
    console.log(`Server responded with "${resp.statusCode}"`)
  }
)

req.on('finish', () => console.log('request sent'))
req.on('close', () => console.log('Connection closed'))
req.on('error', err => console.error(`Request failed: ${err}`))

req.write('writing some content...\n')
req.end('last write & close the stream')
```

When we use `http.request()` we get back a request object. This object is a Writable stream.

We can attach event listeners like `finish` (when the request is fully sent), `close` (when the connection with the server is closed), `error` (to catch any error).

In order to write content to the server through the request object we can invoke `write(data)` and `end(data)`.

These two methods from writable streams allows to write data over the destination. The data can be a string or a `Buffer` instance.

When using `end(data)`, the connection with the destination will be closed after the write is completed, so it is generally used to write the last chunk of data. You can also call `end()` without any data if you want to just close the stream without writing more data.

TODO add output from client and server from previous example

TODO add play section to change the http request

TODO maybe - see if pipedream.net supports images and explain how to send an image from a buffer built through a base64 representation of the data
