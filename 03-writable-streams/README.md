## 03.1 What is a Writable stream

A Writable stream is an abstraction that allows to write data over a destination. In a way you can see Writable streams as an abstraction for output.

Some notable instances of Writable streams:

- Writing to a file with `fs.createWriteStream()`
- Command line standard output and standard error (`process.stdout`, `process.stderr`)
- An HTTP request (when sent by a client)
- An HTTP response (when sent by a server)
- AWS S3 `PutObject` (`body` parameter)
